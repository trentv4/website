todo:
draw lines between mouse buffers, to resolve missed spots when moving the mouse very fast
preview mode for pasting
don't render mouse cursor when it's not on the canvas
change up data structure to a 2d array (faster fetches for certain positions, thus faster redraws on big dungeons)

bugs:
none known

feature requests:
	ability to place notes or numbers on the grid
	scaling option (70x70 exports to roll20)

	tiles:
		chairs
		bookcases
		secret door
		connectors (for stairs, mostly)

	include all basic tools from anamap (mostly done)
	maybe export to jpg
