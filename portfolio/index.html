			<p>I built this project using some of the latest technologies in web development to create this project: <i>node.js</i> and one of it's libraries, <i>express</i>. This is one of my favorite projects to do, and I learned a lot about client/server architecture on the web creating it. </p>

			<p>This project was very quickly built with tech I knew, and grabbing off-the-shelf solutions for the stuff I didn't. In this case, I was able to use 'Tabletop', a JavaScript library built to interface with Google Sheets. This project is one I'm very proud of. I created it as a favor for my Calculus teacher, and gave him access to a Google Sheet so he could create his own flash cards for the class to review.</p>
