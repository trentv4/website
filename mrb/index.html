				This is a collection of college tips given to us by my math professor, Matthew Battisti.
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p>College is your job. You wouldn't skip a shift at work simply because you don't feel like going. I have never seen a student with perfect (or near perfect) attendance get anything less than an A.</p></li>
			<li><p>College is an opportunity to reinvent yourself, especially if you are going away where no one else knows you.</p></li>
			<li><p>First impressions last the longest, and youonly get one opportunity to make that first impression.</p></li>
			<li><p>Life can essentially be modeled with calculus... maximize your happiness by always considering instantaneous results and also long term results, live in the moment, but also don't do things that will allow for short term benefits at the cost of long term goals.</p></li>
			<li><p>When making your schedule, avoid clustering.</p></li>
			<li><p>Research as much as you can before making your schedule! Every major has "weeding out" courses... don't schedule multiple "weeding out" courses in the same semester.</p></li>
			<li><p>Colleges usually use a 4 point scale, typically where an A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0. Most degree programs require a 3.0 cumulative GPA to finish the degree program.</p></li>
			<li><p>When scheduling, persistence is key. Even if a class is full, if you stay persistent, you can usually find a way to get in.</p></li>
			<li><p>"The saddest story of a man's life is full of should haves and could haves." Take risks, it's worth it in the end.</p></li>
			<li><p>The only people who catch their dreams are those bold enough to chase them.</p></li>
			<li><p></p></li>
