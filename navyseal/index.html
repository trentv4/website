Think again! I'm a mod of r/redditarmie and as we speak I will post a thread on reddit to make everyone downvote you, so you better prepare for a storm, m'sir. You are nothing compared to my intelligence. I can send hundreds of reddit troupes anywhere on the internet. I can out-wit you in ANY argument and topic you can think of, kid. I've watched animes for over 12 years and it has thought me countless fighting techniques. I have a fedora collection with over 43 fedoras of all styles and colors. You are nothing compared to me, just another theist ready to be crushed by my wit and supreme intelligence. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little 'clever' comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. I'm gonna make a new meme about you and post it to le reddit aswell. You're done, m'lady.
