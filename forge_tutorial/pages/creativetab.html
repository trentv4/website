<h2>Creative Tabs</h2>
This could not be more simple. Create some class, name it whatever, make sure it extends CreativeTabs
<pre class="code">
	public class ModCreativeTab extends CreativeTabs
	{
		public ModCreativeTab(String label)
		{
			super(label);
		}

		@Override
		public Item getTabIconItem()
		{
			return Mod.someitemBlock;
		}
	}
</pre>
The only thing of note right here is <div class="small-code">public Item getTabIconItem()</div>, which will be the icon that displays on the tab itself. You should probably set this to something in your mod, but hey, <div class="small-code">return Items.FISH;</div> will work just as well.

Now, in your mod class, you're going to want to add this somewhere:
<pre class="code">
	public static final ModCreativeTab CREATIVE_TAB = new ModCreativeTab("creativeTabName");
</pre>
In <div class="small-code">src/main/resources/assets/lang/en_US.lang</div> (and in all of your other language files, if you're using more than en_US), you want to put down:
<pre class="code">
	itemGroup.creativeTabName=The Localized Creative Tab Name
</pre>
Also, whenever you register an item or block you want in the creative tab, call <div class="small-code">setCreativeTab(Mod.CREATIVE_TAB)</div>. If you don't, it won't show up in the tab.
